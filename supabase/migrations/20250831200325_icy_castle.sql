# Fix Profile Creation Trigger and Policies

Fixes the profile creation trigger to work properly for all user roles and updates RLS policies
to ensure profiles are created and accessible after user signup.

## Changes

1. **Updated handle_new_user() function**
   - Properly creates profiles for ALL user roles
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Uses correct metadata extraction

2. **Updated RLS policies**
   - Allows profile creation during signup
   - Ensures profiles are readable after creation
   - Maintains security while enabling proper flow

## Security

- Function runs with SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS during creation
- Policies ensure users can only access their own data
- Proper error handling prevents auth failures
